# My Python Learning Journey: Fundamentals of Python

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my journey of learning the fundamentals of Python. This project is a collection of the code, exercises, and concepts I've worked through. It serves as my practical notebook for mastering the core principles of the language.

## About This Project

As I embarked on learning Python, I decided to create this repository to track my progress and organize everything I learned. Each folder represents a key milestone in my journey, containing the scripts I wrote while exploring and understanding new topics. This is a hands-on log of what I did and what I learned along the way.

## What I've Learned and Practiced

I've structured my learning path into several key areas, with each folder dedicated to a specific concept:

  * ### 1\. Basic Python Operations

    Here, I started with the absolute basics. I practiced declaring variables, using different data types (like integers, strings, and lists), and performing fundamental arithmetic and logical operations. This was the foundation for everything that followed.

  * ### 2\. While & For Loops

    I dove into controlling the flow of my programs. In this section, I wrote various `for` and `while` loops to handle repetitive tasks, iterate over data structures, and build more dynamic scripts.

  * ### 3\. Conditionals

    This is where I learned to make my programs "think." I practiced using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to allow my code to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.

  * ### 4\. Functions & Procedures

    To write cleaner and more efficient code, I learned how to define and call my own functions. This helped me understand how to create reusable blocks of code to perform specific tasks, making my projects much more organized.

  * ### 5\. Using Libraries in Python

    I began exploring the power of Python's vast ecosystem by learning how to import and use external libraries. This opened up a whole new world of possibilities beyond the standard library.

  * ### 6\. Reading & Importing Files

    A crucial skill I picked up was file I/O. I practiced writing scripts to read data from various files and import them into my programs for processing.

  * ### 7\. Classes & Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

    I took a significant step forward by diving into Object-Oriented Programming. Here, I practiced creating my own classes and objects, learning about concepts like inheritance and encapsulation which are fundamental to building complex applications.

  * ### 8\. Recursive Programming

    To challenge my problem-solving skills, I explored recursion. I wrote functions that call themselves to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, more manageable sub-problems.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the folders to see my code. You can clone this repository to run the scripts on your local machine and see how I've approached different problems.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ONGKOKRHUI/Fundamentals_of_Python.git
```

This project is a reflection of my learning process. I hope it can be helpful to others who are also starting their own journey in Python\!
